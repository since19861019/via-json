# via-json
"CIDOO ABM066 USB/24G VIA JSON" files in the epomaker web site have incorrect layouts ("g","t" keys are on the right side). 
The files here have corrected layouts and V3 format, where you don't have to turn on "deprecated" switch in https://usevia.app.

I also updated the AJAZZ AKS068 json file to V3.

abm066.txt is "raw" text file which can be used in KLE editor.
I used MudkipMao/AliceKeyboardLayout as the starting point.
